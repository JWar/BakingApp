/**
 * Created by JonGaming on 27/02/2018.
 * Not sure if this is needed because of MVP but want to see if this works.
 * Trying to see how far onView can traverse the xml tree.
 * TODO: 180227_Look into why prodDebug doesnt work. Think its the Retrofit/Async problem.
 * Basically Mock testing for Mockolate Pie passes, but changing it to Nutella Pie and
 * running it on Prod fails. But there has been one or two occasions when it passed. I suspect
 * this is due to waiting for server response etc... Dont think I need to go into this yet but
 * its something to look out for later.
